# Messanger-All-Conversation-Delete-Partial-Automation

## Description  

This JavaScript script is designed to partially automate the process of deleting chats from Messenger. It works by iterating through your chat list, opening each conversation, and bringing up the delete menu. However, **due to restrictions on automated actions in Messenger, the user must manually confirm the final delete action for each chat**.  

Additionally, the script allows users to **stop the process anytime by pressing the "ESC" key**. It also provides a simple UI overlay on the screen to show the deletion progress, displaying the number of chats processed and the total number of chats detected.  

## Features  

✅ Automatically opens Messenger conversations one by one.  
✅ Brings up the delete menu for each conversation.  
✅ Tracks progress (`Opening chat (X/Y) - Z deleted so far`).  
✅ Allows stopping the script using the "ESC" key.  
✅ Simple status UI for real-time updates.  

❗ **User Action Required**: You must manually click the "Delete" button to confirm the deletion of each chat.  

## How to Run the Script  

1. **Open Messenger in your browser** (https://www.facebook.com/messages/).  
2. **Open Developer Console**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Chrome) or `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Firefox).  
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Option + J` (Chrome) or `Cmd + Option + K` (Firefox).  
3. **Copy and paste the script** into the console.  
4. **Press Enter** to execute the script.  

## How to Stop the Script  

- **Press the "ESC" key** at any time to stop the script.  
- The status message will update to **"⛔ Script Stopped by User (ESC Pressed)"**.  

## Notes  

- This script **does not bypass Messenger restrictions**; it only automates the process up to the point where the user must confirm the deletion.  
- **Use responsibly** – Deleting messages is permanent and cannot be undone.
